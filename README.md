Oussama Turki's Quantum Engineering Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio of projects and coursework from the Master in Quantum Engineering program. This repository showcases my hands-on experience and deep understanding of the key pillars of quantum technology, from foundational theory to advanced, practical applications.

Core Competencies
My studies have provided me with comprehensive expertise in the following key areas:


Quantum Algorithms: In-depth theoretical study and practical implementation of a wide range of algorithms, including the Quantum Fourier Transform , Grover's Search Algorithm , Shor's Factorization Algorithm , the HHL Algorithm , and Quantum Walk Algorithms.






Quantum Hardware Paradigms & Simulation: Hands-on experience with the two leading models of quantum computation: Gate-Based Quantum Computing and Adiabatic Quantum Computing. This includes problem formulation for quantum annealers (QUBOs, Ising Models) and developing for different hardware platforms.






Variational & Optimization Algorithms: Extensive work with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms critical for NISQ-era devices, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) , Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) , and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE).
