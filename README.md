# Oussama Turki — Quantum Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of projects and coursework from the **Master's in Quantum Engineering** program. This repository collects hands-on implementations, notebooks, and reports that demonstrate both the theoretical foundations and applied skills I developed during my studies.

---

## Overview
I focus on quantum algorithms, hardware-aware problem formulation, hybrid quantum-classical methods for NISQ devices, quantum machine learning, quantum communications, and error correction. The work here includes reproducible code, Jupyter notebooks, and short reports summarizing experimental results and design choices.

---

## Core competencies
- **Quantum algorithms** — Theory and implementation of algorithms such as Quantum Fourier Transform, Grover’s search, Shor’s factoring, HHL, Quantum Phase Estimation, and quantum walk methods.  
- **Quantum hardware paradigms & simulation** — Gate-based and adiabatic models; QUBO / Ising formulations for annealers; hardware-aware mapping and simulation.  
- **Variational & optimization algorithms** — Design and evaluation of hybrid algorithms (VQE, QAOA, QAE) and classical optimizer integration for NISQ devices.  
- **Quantum machine learning** — Prototyping quantum neural circuits, embeddings, and hybrid approaches using PennyLane / TFQ.  
- **Quantum communications & cryptography** — Practical exercises in QKD, entanglement protocols (teleportation, dense coding), and quantum data compression.  
- **Quantum error correction & mitigation** — Stabilizer codes, syndrome extraction analysis, and NISQ-era mitigation techniques.

---

## Repository structure
Each top-level folder contains projects, notebooks, datasets (when allowed), and a folder README with setup and execution instructions.

1. `Foundations-and-Introduction`  
   Core postulates, Hilbert spaces, linear operators, qubits, basic gates and circuits, and short exercises.

2. `Quantum-Algorithms`  
   Implementations and analyses of Deutsch–Jozsa, Bernstein–Vazirani, Simon’s algorithm, Phase Estimation, Shor’s algorithm, and related benchmarks.

3. `Gate-Based-Quantum-Computing`  
   Qiskit/Cirq notebooks and scripts for Grover, HHL, VQE, QAOA, and gate-level experiments with simulator and hardware backends.

4. `Adiabatic-Quantum-Computing`  
   Problem formulation (QUBO/Ising), mapping classical optimization problems (Knapsack, MIS) to annealers, and experiments with quantum-annealing toolchains.

5. `Quantum-Communications-and-Cryptography`  
   Exercises and reports on entanglement, teleportation, dense coding, and practical QKD protocol simulations.

6. `Quantum-Error-Correction`  
   Analysis, simulations, and design exercises for stabilizer codes and error-correcting strategies.

> Each project folder includes a short summary, required dependencies (`requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`), and runnable examples or notebooks. Check the README inside each folder for reproducibility instructions.

---

## How to run
1. Create a Python virtual environment (venv or conda).  
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.  
3. Open the notebook or run the example script listed in each project’s README.  
4. For hardware experiments, follow the notes in the folder README (API keys/backends are **not** included).

---

## Selected highlights
- Implemented circuit optimizations and comparative benchmarks for gate depth and fidelity across different transpiler settings.  
- Developed hybrid VQE/QAOA pipelines with parameter-shift derivatives and classical optimizer comparisons.  
- Formulated and solved QUBO encodings for combinatorial instances and tested annealer-centric embeddings.
